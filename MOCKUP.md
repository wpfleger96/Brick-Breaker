#GUI Mockup

STATE 1:

This is the beginning of the game. The ball is instantiated right above the paddle.

STATE 2:

This is what happens when the user hits a brick. A grey "crack" appears in the brick after the first contact with the ball and a second crack will appear
on the second hit. Once the ball hits the brick the third time, the brick is destroyed.

This is what happens when the user loses a life. When the ball touches the bottom of the screen (not blocked by the paddle), the user loses one of his
3 lives.


STATE 4:

This is what happens when the user loses. When the user loses his last life, "GAME OVER" appears on the screen and the game ends.

POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE FROM MOCKUP:
I may change the design of the bricks, and the colors of all on-screen objects. The text displaying the current level and number of lives may change as well.
There will be overall tweaks to make the appearance of the game look better.

EDIT:
I have changed the appearance of the bricks since I created the mockup. Instead of the bricks cracking, they change colors. The bricks begin blue and when hit they turn yellow, then red, then they dissapear when they are broken.
